// This module confirms that every command in the supported product command set
// is reachable through the explicit host/guest boundary introduced in
// boundary.rs. A command that appears in the CLI but is missing from the
// GuestRuntime or HostControlPlane surface is a parity gap.
//
// Supported command set (from docs/implementation-plan.md Phase 1):
//   build-base, fork, exec, diff, du, export-patch, gc, bench, doctor
//
// Deprecated commands retained for migration compatibility:
//   mount-path, unmount
//
// The tests below exercise the boundary surface rather than the underlying OS
// primitives, so they run in the PR-tier harness without root, KVM, or a live
// Firecracker instance.

/// Parity record for a single supported command.
///
/// Each entry confirms which boundary surface the command belongs to and
/// whether the corresponding GuestRuntime or HostControlPlane method exists.
