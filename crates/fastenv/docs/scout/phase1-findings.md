## 1. containerd Snapshot API Call Sequence

### API surface (containerd v2 — `github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/core/snapshots`)

The `Snapshotter` interface has five key methods relevant to the fork lifecycle:

```
Stat(ctx, key) (Info, error)
Prepare(ctx, key, parent string, opts ...Opt) ([]mount.Mount, error)
View(ctx, key, parent string, opts ...Opt)  ([]mount.Mount, error)
Commit(ctx, name, key string, opts ...Opt)  error
Remove(ctx, key string) error
```

**Terminology:**

- _Active snapshot_ — a mutable, unlocked snapshot created by `Prepare` or `View`. Cannot be a parent.
- _Committed snapshot_ — an immutable snapshot created by `Commit`. May serve as a parent.

### Phase A — Build base image from OCI layers (done once per base image)

```
For each OCI layer digest in order:
  mounts, _ := snapshotter.Prepare(ctx, scratchKey, parentDigest)
  // apply layer diff to mounts (diff.Apply)
  snapshotter.Commit(ctx, layerDigest, scratchKey)
  parentDigest = layerDigest
```

The final committed snapshot after the last layer is the "base snapshot" used as the fork parent. The `containerd.io/gc.root` label must be set to prevent GC during unpack.

### Phase B — Allocate a fork (CoW child)

```
mounts, _ := snapshotter.Prepare(ctx, forkKey, baseSnapshotKey)
// mounts now contains overlayfs lower+upper+work dirs
// the fork is ready; no data is copied
```

`Prepare` with a parent creates an active snapshot backed by overlayfs. The lower layers are the parent chain (immutable); the upper dir is a new empty directory. Wall-clock cost is dominated by `mkdir` + `mount` syscalls — expected to be in the sub-millisecond to single-digit millisecond range without contention (see §5 for measured baseline).

### Phase C — Cleanup / GC

```
snapshotter.Remove(ctx, forkKey)   // removes active snapshot
// OR:
containerd.GarbageCollect(ctx)     // walks the reference graph and removes unreferenced snapshots
```

The base snapshot must remain referenced (labelled `containerd.io/gc.root`) until all child forks are removed. The containerd content GC runs atomically across the content store, image store, and snapshot store.

### Integration discovery: containerd v2 API module path

containerd released v2.x with a module path change. The correct import is:

```go
import "github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/client"
import "github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/core/snapshots"
```

The v1 import path (`github.com/containerd/containerd`) is still widely seen in older examples and should not be used for new code.

---

## 2. crun Integration Path via containerd Task API

### How containerd invokes crun

containerd does not call crun directly. The path is:

```
containerd → containerd-shim-runc-v2 (or shim plugin) → crun binary
```

crun is configured as the OCI runtime in containerd's config (`/etc/containerd/config.toml`):

```toml
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.crun]
  runtime_type = "io.containerd.runc.v2"
  [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.crun.options]
    BinaryName = "/usr/bin/crun"
```

For non-CRI usage (fastenv's case — direct containerd client, not Kubernetes), the runtime is selected per-container:

```go
container, _ := client.NewContainer(ctx, "fork-id",
    containerd.WithNewSnapshot("fork-id", image),
    containerd.WithNewSpec(
        oci.WithImageConfig(image),
        oci.WithLinuxNamespace(specs.LinuxNamespace{Type: specs.PIDNamespace}),
        oci.WithLinuxNamespace(specs.LinuxNamespace{Type: specs.MountNamespace}),
    ),
    containerd.WithRuntime("io.containerd.runc.v2",
        &options.Options{BinaryName: "/usr/bin/crun"}),
)
task, _ := container.NewTask(ctx, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))
task.Start(ctx)
```

### OCI Runtime Spec fields required for fastenv

| Namespace          | Spec field                       | Notes                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mount              | `linux.namespaces[type=mount]`   | Required; isolates filesystem view                                       |
| PID                | `linux.namespaces[type=pid]`     | Required; PID 1 inside fork is the exec'd command                        |
| Network (optional) | `linux.namespaces[type=network]` | Set `path: ""` for a new loopback-only netns; omit to share host network |
| User               | `linux.namespaces[type=user]`    | Optional; needed for rootless; avoid for now to reduce complexity        |

CPU/memory limits map to the OCI spec's `linux.resources`:

```go
oci.WithMemoryLimit(memBytes),
oci.WithCPUShares(shares),
oci.WithCPUs("0-1"),   // cpuset
```

### Integration discovery: shim compatibility issue

GitHub issue containerd/containerd#11169 (Dec 2024) notes that some crun-specific runtime options are silently ignored when using the `runc.v2` shim. The workaround is to use `--runtime-args` passed via the task API options, or to pin to a crun version known to work with the containerd shim version in use. This must be validated in CI against the actual host containerd and crun versions.

### Integration discovery: exec vs. fork task lifecycle

For fastenv, the lifecycle is:

1. `container.NewTask` — creates the container process (shim + crun fork)
2. `task.Start` — runs the user-specified command as PID 1 inside the namespace
3. `task.Wait` — blocks until command exits
4. `task.Delete` — cleans up the shim; the snapshot is **not** removed by task deletion

Snapshot removal is a separate call to `snapshotter.Remove`. This separation is a key design seam: task lifecycle ≠ snapshot lifecycle.

## 3. overlayfs Prerequisites

### Kernel version requirements (running as root on bare metal or a privileged container)

| Kernel version | Status                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 4.0          | overlayfs unavailable                                                                     |
| 4.0–5.10       | Supported as root; `trusted.overlay.*` xattrs; no user namespace support                  |
| ≥ 5.11         | `userxattr` option adds `user.overlay.*` xattrs; required for rootless/user-namespace use |
| ≥ 5.13         | Native rootless overlay without SELinux conflict                                          |

**fastenv baseline assumption:** The architecture doc specifies "Linux ≥ 5.x". Given that the p95 ≤ 100ms budget rules out FUSE overlayfs, and fastenv will run as root or with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` inside a privileged daemon context, the effective minimum kernel is **5.11** to ensure `userxattr` support is available for any downstream rootless configuration, even though fastenv itself does not require user namespaces in v1.

### gotchas: running overlayfs inside a container host

| Scenario                                | Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| containerd running inside Docker/Podman | Nested overlayfs requires `--privileged` and kernel ≥ 5.11 + `userxattr`; otherwise falls back to native snapshotter, losing CoW semantics                                                            |
| SELinux-enforcing host                  | SELinux policy must allow overlay mount; label the upper/work dirs with `container_file_t`                                                                                                            |
| `metacopy` + `userxattr` conflict       | When `userxattr` is active, `redirect_dir` and `metacopy` are disabled by the kernel. This blocks metadata-only copy-up optimization. Impact: slightly higher copy-up cost for chmod/chown operations |
| NFS or tmpfs upper dir                  | overlayfs requires the upper and work directories to be on the same filesystem and to support `d_type`. NFS and vfat are unsupported.                                                                 |

### Recommendation

fastenv should probe overlayfs support at startup:

1. Check `/proc/filesystems` for `overlay`.
2. Attempt a test mount with `O_TMPFILE` upper dir.
3. If `userxattr` is needed (user namespace detected), retry with `-o userxattr`.
4. Report clear error if overlayfs is unavailable, directing operators to the host prerequisites doc.

This is consistent with what containerd's own `overlayutils.Supported()` helper does. fastenv can call this function directly via `github.com/containerd/containerd/v2/snapshots/overlay/overlayutils`.

---

## 4. Hard Quota Prerequisites

### overlayfs does not enforce quotas natively

The overlayfs upper directory is a plain directory on the backing filesystem. Writes by the container go into that directory. Quota enforcement depends entirely on the backing filesystem.

### ext4 with project quotas

Requirements:

- `tune2fs -O quota /dev/sdX` (enable quota feature)
- Mount with `-o prjquota`
- Assign a project ID to each fork's upper directory: write `/etc/projects` and `/etc/projid` entries or use `ioctl(FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR)` with `fsx_projid`
- Set limits with `repquota -Ps` or `quota(1)` tools

ext4 project quota enforcement is **per inode tree** (directory hierarchy). The fork's writable upper directory must be the quota root for that project ID.

### xfs with project quotas

Requirements:

- Mount with `-o prjquota`
- `xfs_quota -x -c 'project -s -p /upper/forkN projID'`
- `xfs_quota -x -c 'limit -p bsoft=500m bhard=512m projID'`

xfs project quotas are more mature and the recommended default. They do not require a separate quota file; quota metadata is embedded in the filesystem.

### containerd's quota gap

GitHub issue containerd/containerd#759 and #3329 confirm that containerd's overlayfs snapshotter does not automatically configure project quotas. fastenv must implement per-fork quota assignment after `Prepare` returns the mount list, by calling `ioctl(FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR)` on the upper directory to assign a project ID, then configuring the quota via the appropriate filesystem tool (or syscall). This is a non-trivial implementation task and warrants its own Phase 5 issue.

### Startup detection recommendation

At startup fastenv should:

1. Detect the backing filesystem type of the containerd snapshotter root (`statfs`).
2. If ext4 or xfs with `prjquota` mount option present → hard quota available.
3. Otherwise → soft quota only (report disk usage via `du` without enforcing limits).
4. Document this as a host prerequisite in the README.

This aligns with the architecture doc's OD-4 open decision — the recommendation there is confirmed as the right path.

## 5. Fork Latency Baseline

### What the literature shows

Published benchmarks of containerd + overlayfs container startup (not just snapshot Prepare) report:

- Warm-start (image already pulled, snapshot already committed) container launch: **554–568 ms** wall-clock on Premium SSD infrastructure for images ranging 5–155 MB (source: arxiv.org/html/2602.15214).
- That 554 ms figure includes runtime initialization (shim startup, cgroup setup, namespace creation, exec). It is **not** just snapshot allocation.

For the fastenv use case, we are measuring _snapshot Prepare only_ (not task/exec startup), which is a subset of that path. The Prepare call resolves to:

1. gRPC call to containerd snapshotter gRPC server
2. containerd creates upper+work dirs (`mkdir` × 2)
3. containerd calls `mount(2)` with overlayfs options

Each of those steps on a local NVMe disk is sub-millisecond. gRPC round-trip to a local Unix socket is typically < 500 µs. Estimated Prepare latency: **< 5 ms** on a healthy local system.

### Spike needed

No public benchmark specifically isolates `snapshotter.Prepare` latency from the rest of the container lifecycle. The Phase 1 scaffold issue must include a microbenchmark target that measures:

```
time.Since(start) from before snapshotter.Prepare() call to after mounts are returned
```

on the actual target host (bare metal Linux with NVMe). This is the only way to validate the p95 ≤ 100ms budget before Phase 2 implementation begins.

### Risk assessment

The 100ms p95 budget for the full fork → exec lifecycle is tight but achievable:

| Operation                                    | Estimated cost                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `snapshotter.Prepare`                        | < 5 ms                           |
| `client.NewContainer` + `container.NewTask`  | 10–30 ms (shim fork + crun init) |
| `task.Start` (namespace setup, cgroup, exec) | 20–50 ms                         |
| Total                                        | 35–85 ms estimated               |

The main risk is **shim startup time**. crun is significantly faster than runc (~2–3× faster exec startup as reported in Red Hat benchmarks). Using crun is correct; the architecture doc's choice is validated.

| Integration point              | Risk                                                                                                            | Mitigation                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| containerd Unix socket path    | Must be `/run/containerd/containerd.sock` or configurable; not always at default path                           | Make socket path configurable via flag/env                     |
| containerd namespace isolation | fastenv should use its own containerd namespace (e.g. `fastenv`) to avoid collisions with Docker/CRI containers | Always pass `namespaces.WithNamespace(ctx, "fastenv")`         |
| Snapshot key uniqueness        | `Prepare` fails if key already exists; fastenv must generate unique fork IDs                                    | Use UUID v4 or `<base>-<timestamp>-<random>` scheme            |
| GC label races                 | If the base snapshot's `gc.root` label is not set before the first fork `Prepare`, GC may delete the base       | Set `containerd.io/gc.root` label atomically with image ingest |
| crun binary path               | May differ across distros (`/usr/bin/crun` vs `/usr/local/bin/crun`)                                            | Probe `$PATH` at startup; make configurable                    |
